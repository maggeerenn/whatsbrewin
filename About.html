<div class="growingup">Growing up, I worked in this exact location. While it was not the same coffee shop it was today, it is very similar. Since I worked at a coffee shop from such a young age, I understood how much coffee could bring people together. One day, I deiced to take ownership as what we now know as What’s Brewin. I founded What’s Bewin on the idea that people can come together through coffee and I wanted to create an environment for just that. </div>
